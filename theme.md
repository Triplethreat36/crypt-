The map crypt is a single player map based on a post the cathedral was exposed as a onholy spot and the battle left the place in runes of it once glory. Now the vatican sent you to investigate the drak truth that been awaked in the depth of the crypt under the cathedral. 

the main theme im going for dark and and  feel terrified.

the player should look out for more close up combat.

my plan is to have the dark forces that have been unleashed with some crazy cuts.

the cathedral was destroyed due to unatral forces

main location is in a cathedral destrotyed and opend up in a crypt
