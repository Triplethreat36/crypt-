1. The fix was to move the button in the first room so the player can get an important weapon.
   
2. Add less enemies by 1 in the room with the zombies and death knight and knights.
   
3. Add dogs or high chasing enemies so the player uses more lighting gun ammo.
   
4. Add a drop so the boss doesnâ€™t attack immediately without adding a Square wall.
